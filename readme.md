What is this?
-------------
It's a rich text editor. You can bold, italic, and type stuff. It works off a JSON model, not the DOM, so it's less likely to break in weird ways. You can select text, hit bold or italic, and it does the right thing (even if you select a mix of bold and not-bold, it will make it all bold or all not-bold, like a real editor should). The main idea is that you can create your own options for it.

How do I use it?
----------------
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it. No build step, no npm, no nothing. Just double click or drag it into Chrome/Safari/whatever.

2. You'll see a toolbar with Bold and Italic buttons, and a big white box. Type in the box. Select some text, click Bold or Italic. Magic.

3. The editor keeps its state in a JSON model, so you could (if you wanted) add export/import features, or inspect the model for fun. (Not included by default, but easy to add.)

How does it work?
-----------------
- All the text and formatting is stored in a JS array like:

	```js
	[
		{ text: "Hello ", bold: true },
		{ text: "world", italic: true }
	]
	```

- When you type or format, it updates the model and re-renders the editor. No `execCommand`, no browser weirdness.

Features
--------
- Bold and Italic (more can be added easily)
- Handles mixed selections (see above)
- No dependencies, just HTML/CSS/JS
- Modern, clean UI (see `styles.css`)

Example custom usage
-------------

```html
<div id="editor" class="richtext-editor" contenteditable="true"></div>
<script src="richtext-editor.js"></script>
<script>
	const editor = new RichTextEditor(document.getElementById('editor'));
	// To bold: editor.bold();
	// To italic: editor.italic();
</script>
```

You can hook up your own buttons, or feel free to use the ones in the demo.


Want to add your own formats?
----------------------------
It's super easy now. All formatting is handled by classes, so you can add any format you want (like `code`, `highlight`, `red`, etc) and style it in CSS.

How to add a new format (example: highlight):

1. Add a method to the class:

	```js
	highlight() {
	  this.toggleFormat('highlight');
	}
	```

2. Add a button in your HTML and hook it up:

	```html
	<button onclick="editor.highlight()">Highlight</button>
	```

3. Add a CSS rule for the class:

	```css
	.highlight {
	  background: yellow;
	}
	```

That's it! When you call `editor.highlight()`, it will toggle the `highlight` class on the selected text. You can add as many as you want, and style them however you like.

How does it work?
-----------------
- Each format is just a key in the model (e.g. `{ text: 'foo', bold: true, highlight: true }`).
- When rendering, all formats are turned into classes on a `<span>`, so you can style them in CSS.
- The `toggleFormat` method does all the logic for youâ€”no need to change the rendering or model code.

That's it. Enjoy!
